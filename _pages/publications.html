<p>Formula SAE is an international competiton organized by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). Every year, Texas A&M designs, manufactures, and assembles an electric and internal combustion formula-style vehicle. I am part of the electric team.

<h2>2026 Season</h2>

<p>I am currently part of the chassis subteam. This year, I am aiming to bring substantial structure upgrades to the vehcile. This includes moving the rear bulkhead forward, reducing the number of members required while providing the aerodynamics subteam additional volume for the rear diffuser.
Additionally, I am working closely with the drivers to improve the ergonomics of the vehicle by developing custom driver models to ensure proper clearances and comfort.</p>

<h2>2025 Season</h2>

<p>For the 2025 season, I was a key member of of the suspension subsystem team with a focus on the steering system. My role also extended to integrating our vehicle dynamic simulation software (Optimum Kinematics) with our vehicle assembly software (Solidworks).
My design process revolved around determining the Ackermann ratio which, put simply, is the ratio between steering angles of the left and right wheels. The purpose of the ratio is to reduce tire wear while accounting for lateral grip.
I established my ratio accounting for the track width and wheel base of the vehicle as well as other vehicular constraints. I implemented the ratio into the simulation software. Additionally, I adjusted the geometry to mitigate bump steer.
This is where small vertical translations in the front wheels results in slight steering generated which negatively impacts handling characteristics.<p/>

<p>The first two pictures show the progression from Optimum Kinematics to Solidworks via an algorithim I made. Then after adding other components a complete assembly of the control arms was created. Lastly adding the chassis, wheels, and anti-roll bar assemblies completes the suspension assembly.</p>

<h2>2024 Season</h2>
<p>For the 2024 season, I was part of the chassis subsystem. I was responsible for the chassis integration with the electronics subsystem as well as the driver model and a couple other smaller projects.<p/>

<p>Below is the scale articulable driver model. This file was a 1:1 scale model of our driver and could be moved into multiple positions. This helped establish the position of the steering wheel and seat, ensure rules compliance, and aerodynamic simulations.<p/>
