<h2>2025 Season</h2>
I am currently part of the suspension subsystem. My area of focus is with the steering system. I am also responsible for integrating our vehicle dynamic simulation software (Optimum Kinematics) with our vehicle assembly software (Solidworks).

<h2>2024 Season</h2>
For the 2024 season, I was part of the chassis subsystem. I was responsible for the chassis integration with the electronics subsystem as well as the driver model and a couple other smaller projects.

Below is the scale articulable driver model. This file was a 1:1 scale model of our driver and could be moved into multiple positions. This helped establish the position of the steering wheel and seat, ensure rules compliance, and aerodynamic simulations.
