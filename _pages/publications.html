<h2>2025 Season</h2>
I am currently part of the suspension subsystem. My area of focus is with the steering system. I am also responsible for integrating our vehicle dynamic simulation software (Optimum Kinematics) with our vehicle assembly software (Solidworks).
My design process revolved around determining the Ackermann ratio. Simply put, this is the ratio between steering anlges between the left and right wheels. The purpose of the ratio is to reduce tire wear while accounting for lateral grip.
I established my ratio accounting for the track width and wheel base of the vehicle as well as other vehicular constraints. I implemented the ratio into the simulation software. Additionally, had to adjust the geometry to mitigate bump steer.
This is where small vertical translations in the front wheels results in slight steering generated which negatively impacts handling characteristics.

<h2>2024 Season</h2>
For the 2024 season, I was part of the chassis subsystem. I was responsible for the chassis integration with the electronics subsystem as well as the driver model and a couple other smaller projects.

Below is the scale articulable driver model. This file was a 1:1 scale model of our driver and could be moved into multiple positions. This helped establish the position of the steering wheel and seat, ensure rules compliance, and aerodynamic simulations.
