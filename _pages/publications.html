<p>Formula SAE is an international competition organized by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). 
Every year, Texas A&M designs, manufactures, and assembles an electric and an internal combustion formula-style vehicle. 
I am an engineering lead on the electric team.

<h2>2026 Season</h2>

<p>I am currently a lead on the chassis subteam. This year, I aim to bring substantial structure upgrades to the vehicle. 
This includes moving the rear bulkhead forward, thereby reducing the number of members required and providing the aerodynamics 
subteam additional volume for the rear diffuser. Additionally, I work closely with the drivers to improve the ergonomics 
of the vehicle by developing custom driver models to ensure proper clearances and comfort. Stay tuned for more updates!

<h2>2025 Season</h2>

<p>For the 2025 season, I was a key member of the suspension subsystem team with a focus on the steering system. 
My role also extended to integrating our vehicle dynamic simulation software (Optimum Kinematics) with our vehicle assembly 
software (Solidworks). My design process revolved around determining the Ackermann ratio, which, simply put, is the ratio 
between the steering angles of the left and right wheels. The purpose of the ratio is to reduce tire wear while accounting for 
lateral grip. I established my ratio accounting for the track width and wheel base of the vehicle, as well as other vehicular 
constraints. I implemented the ratio into the simulation software. Additionally, I adjusted the geometry to mitigate bump steer.
This is where small vertical translations in the front wheels result in slight steering angles, which could negatively impact
handling characteristics.
<p/>

<p>The first two pictures show the progression from Optimum Kinematics to SolidWorks via an algorithm I developed. 
Then, after adding other components, a complete assembly of the control arms was created. Lastly, adding the chassis, wheels, 
and anti-roll bar assemblies complete the suspension assembly.

<h2>2024 Season</h2>
<p>For the 2024 season, I was part of the chassis subsystem. I was responsible for the chassis integration with the electronics 
subsystem as well as the driver model and a couple other smaller projects.

<p>Below is the scale articulable driver model. This file was a 1:1 scale model of our driver and could be moved into multiple 
positions. This helped establish the position of the steering wheel and seat, ensure rules compliance, and perform 
aerodynamic simulations.
