<h2>2025 Season</h2>
I am currently part of the suspension subsystem. My area of focus is with the steering system.

<h2>2024 Season</h2>
For the 2024 season, I was part of the chassis subsystem. I was responsible for the chassis integration with the electronics subsystem as well as the driver model and a couple other smaller projects.
