I am a Sophomore at Texas A&M University pursuing a BSc. in Mechanical Engineering with a minors in Materials Science and Mathematics. My passion lies in robotics and vehicle dynamics. I have contributed to groundbreaking research in the mechanical design of space-rated robotic actuators. I am also a engineer on the electric racing team where I am currently designing and manufacturing the steering system of the 2025 competition vehicle.
