I am a Junior at Texas A&M University pursuing a BSc. in Mechanical Engineering with minors in Materials Science and Mathematics. My passion lies in robotics and vehicle dynamics. I have contributed to groundbreaking research in the mechanical design of space-rated robotic actuators. I am also an engineering lead on the formula electric racing team, where I am currently designing the chassis of the 2026 competition vehicle.
