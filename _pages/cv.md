## Experience
**Robotics Automation and Design (RAD) Lab**

*Manupulator Group  -  Summer 2025*

* Designed, manufactured, and tested a modular parasitic torque testbed to measure resistance created by external cable harnesses on a robotic arm for Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO)
* Modeled 3D printing compatible components to make them DFM/DFA fariendly
* Led development and manufacturing of an enclosure to test custom motor controllers with an absolute rotary encoder, achieving perfect concentricity and z-height
* Produced a scale and functional model of the 3-DOF robotic arm to organize internall wire harnessing and determine assmbly procedures


*Space Modular Manupulator Group  -  Summer 2024*

* Co-designed robotic actuators for a 7-DOF robotifc arm, reducing mass and improving harmonic drive efficiency in collaboration with NASA engineers
* Developed a wire harness fatigue testebed, simulating a space environment, vacuum, and heating/cooling, for life-cycle validation over 1 million cycles
* Created engineering calculators in Visual Basic to determine the minimum bolt sizes for dynamic fictured, enhancing safety and precision in structural design


**Beekeeper**

*Great Hills Honey Company  -  March 2018 - August 2023*

* Used integrated pest management techniques to control Varroa Mite infestation in hives
* Implemented weight and temperature sensors to monitor hive healt remotely, preventing colony collapse
* Engineered solution to increase honey extraction efficieny with applied heaters to reduce honey viscosity, two stage filtering to reduce clogging, and mounts to reduce extractor vibrations

## Activities & Projects
**Texas A&M Formula Electric Racing** | *September 2023 - Present*

* 2+ years of progressively challenging experiences on multiple subteams (Chassis, Suspension, Aerodynamics)
* Designed, manufactured, assembled, and raced an electric formula-style vehicle within a one year cycle
* Designed a full-size and functional driver model to optimize ergonomics and aerodynamics
* Led end-to-end design and fabrication of a custom Pro-Ackermann steering system, optimizing lateral force and handling characteristics while minimizing tire scrub
* Developed a algorithm to convert designs from the simulation software (Optimum Kinematics) to the modeling software (Solidworks), removing human error and saving significant time
* Created a full-size and functional driver model optimizing ergonomics/aerodynamics, ensuring rules compliance
* Mapped the vehicle rollover envelope to enable the first fully rules compliant vehicle in the history of the program and maximize safety

**Student Engineers Council** | *February 2024 - Present*
* Organized and planned events for College of Engineering Students
* Hosted multiple company speak series for more than 500 students
* Coordinated College of Engineering department information sessions for Freshman
