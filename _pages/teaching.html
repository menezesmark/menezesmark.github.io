<h3>Beekeeping</h3>

<p>I have enjoyed beekeeping as a personal hobby since I was 10 years old. Since then, I have leaned into my engineering skills 
and have developed tools to improve the health of my hives as well as make beekeeping easier. Initially, this involved 
implementing weight sensors on the hives to continuously read the weight of the hives. This data was used to predict colony 
collapse, allowing us to intervene before a hive would die.

<p>During honey extractions, the bottleneck often occurred when filtering and extracting the honey through the centrifuge. I 
realized that heating the chamber with a hair dryer would improve the viscosity and make the honey flow more smoothly. To develop 
this further, I implemented heating pads wrapped in reflective material to direct as much heat into the chamber. This improved 
the flow of honey by 20%.
