<h2>Personal Projects</h2>
<h3>Beekeeping</h3>
<p>I have enjoyed beekeeping as a personal hobby since I was 10. Since then, my engineering side has pushed its way into the field and I have began developing tools to improve the health of my hives as well as
make my life easier. Initially this involved implementing weight sensors at home hives to continiously read the weight of the hives. This data was used to predict colony collapse allowing beekeepers to intervene before 
the hive would die.</p>

<p>During honey extractions, the bottleneck often occured when filtering and extracting the honey through the centrifuge. I reailzed that heating the chamber with a hair dryer would improve the viscoity and make the honey
flow more smoothly. To develop this further, I implemented heating pads wrapped in reflective material to direct as much heat into the chamber. Now the slowdown was filtering. This was easily fixed through multiple filters 
which gradually decrease in size.</p>
