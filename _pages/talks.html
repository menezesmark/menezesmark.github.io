<h3>Summer 2025</h3>
<p>Designed, manufactured, and assembled a parasitic torque testbet to measure the effect of external cable harnessing on a space rated robotic arm. Two configurations, roll and pitch
  
</p>

<h3>Summer 2024</h3>
<p>Developed a program to determine minimum bolt sizes for fixtures in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). Leveraged Shigley's Mechanical Engineering Design and inputs from material thickness and force required.
<p/>

<p>Designed and manufactured a million cycle testbed for wire torsion.

<p>Designed space-rated harmonic drive oscilators. Minimizing width and length while maximizing inner bore diameter. I had to package a motor and torsion spring along with numerous encoders and bearings. I am unable to produce pictures due to security reasons.
