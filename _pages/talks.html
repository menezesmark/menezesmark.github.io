<a href="https://rad.engr.tamu.edu/"><h2> Robotics Automation and Design (RAD) Lab</h2></a>
<p>Due to the sensitive nature of the work at the lab, I am unable to go into significant details about the projects.</p>


<h3>Summer 2025</h3>
<p>Designed, manufactured, and assembled a parasitic torque testbet to measure the effect of external cable harnessing on a space rated robotic arm. I designed the tesbted with two configurations, roll and pitch. 
These positions simulate the two arrangements the external cable harness will mount to the arm. I opted for maximum adjustability with both the rigid and moving mounts to test infinte positions. 
Additionally, I ensured it was easy to change between the two configurations (roll/pitch)  
</p>

<p>I developed a specalized enclsure to test custom motor controlers. The enclsures housed an absolute rotary encoder which connected to the motor controler through a custom PCB.
I acheived the high tolerances necessary when working with encoders. This includes concentricity between the rotor and stator as well as the proper z-height between the two components. 
</p>

<p>I produced produced a scale functional model of the robotic arm. This served a couple of purposes. Firstly, it allowed for test fitting and harnessing to be done. It is difficult to do this in CAD due to the numerous complex 
bends present. Additionally visualization can be difficult from a computer screen so a physical model helped grasp the scale of components. Secondy, the model allowed the lab to develop asembly procedures for the arm.
</p>


<h3>Summer 2024</h3>
<p>Developed a program to determine minimum bolt sizes for fixtures in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). The algorithm leveraged equations from Shigley's Mechanical Engineering Design textbookd and user inputs 
such as the thickness of the two materials, the desired preload, and strength of the bolt. The function would return the minimum size bolt for the fixture for both Metric and Imperial hardware.
<p/>

<p>Designed and manufactured a million cycle testbed for wire torsion. This testbed continiously twisted the cable harness (not shown) that runs down the central bore of the actuators. 
The harness contains various data cables and high current space-rated power cables. Failure was determine when the internal resistance of the power cables had doubled.

<p>Designed space-rated Series Elastic harmonic drive oscilators. Minimizing width and length while maximizing inner bore diameter. I had to package a motor and torsion spring along with numerous encoders and bearings. 
Two encoders determine the delta in output between the motor and arm which would be the deflection of the spring. With this angle, one could calculate the torque on the arm. 
I am unable to produce pictures due to security reasons.
